League Table Calculation
====

This is an example for evaluation on player stats in a league, 
i.e. number of played games, wins, draws, points and tiebreakers. 
Therefore singletons, factories and a facades come into play.

Subsequently all player results are sorted using multiple properties as you
usually know from SQL but this is on a map of objects. 

STARTING POINT: MatchStats()!!!


Unit Testing
====
For all classes including factories and especially sorting unit tests do
exist. In addition, exceptions and singletons are tested resulting in a
complete code coverage.
